                  HDDExplorer 1.2 has been released. Not much has changed, just a fix for DMS3 v1.0 users. As usual you can grab this in the downloads section.<br>
                  <br>
                  <font color="#FFFF00">14.10.2004</font><br>
                  DMS Flash 2.4 Beta 3 has been released, introducing some nice new features:<br>
                  <br>
                  - Y-position fix when PS2 video fix is activated (this feature is exclusive to DMS3 :))<br>
                  - Force PAL60 mode<br>
                  <br>
                  For more information please see the dedicated forum thread.<br>
                  <br>
                  <font color="#FFFF00">07.10.2004</font><br>
                  In light of recent events on a certain PS2 news site we felt that we could not let their allegations unanswered. The DMS team chose our distribution partner Divineo very carefully, based on their quality of service, reputation and comprehensive stock of all product lines. We're wise enought to realise that the market requires diversity, and to acheive diversity, that means other products in the market. Divineo stock a vast range of modchip products from many vendors, and that's precisely why we chose them. We know that they're fair, honest well respected and trusted as a source by many resellers and that's why we asked them to manage our distribution. The resellers know that they have not been in any way forced to buy DMS products. Our products are offered to resellers in the same way that all others are, that's the simple truth of the matter. DMS has always sold on it's own merits, quality and innovation, which is why we remain popular today. What you're seeing now is the result of a certain individual at the news site trying to bias the individual against DMS by spreading lies and trying to convince the scene that we are "muscling" the resellers. The simple fact of the matter is that DMS has always sold because users loved the innovation we provided. They will probably love the next generation of our mod, for exactly the same reasons. DMS has always strived to bring innovation to our products, this can only be done in a marketplace where there is a dynamic evolution of the products. This is achieved by users having the choice of which product to buy, which is exactly the reason we chose Divineo. So, the allegations made by the news site are unfounded and would appear a sham for trying to fuel a childish vendetta. It is interesting that the news site avoided posting news of the DMS4 release, even though it offers exactly what their users seek, which is a modchip for the homebrew community. It would seem then that the site is more interested in spreading lies than informing the scene of real news and devlopments.<br>
                  <br>
                  We're not interested in playing childish games, so we'll stick to what we do best, which is to make quality products which are innovative. In relation to comments about flash content, we'd just like to say that we're catering for the legal homebrew community. As with any product it can be hacked without any doubt, but we don't condone the hacking or manipulation of our flash content. However should somebody choose to hack it, there's liitle we can do to prevent this.<br>

                  v5/v6 diagrams for DMS3 plus are now online. We omitted from the diagrams the optional T wire which is required for DVD+RW support, we will add this ASAP. In the meantime you can refer to DMS3 V2 and V9 diagrams for positioning of the T wire. We also wish to make clear that some of the pictures have low resolution and are temporary as such. We are now preparing higher resolution diagrams for V3,V4, V9 and V10. They will be online as soon as they are completed. We spent a little too much time developing the mod I'm afraid, which didn't leave enough time for diagarms. Anyway, we're doing our best to get high quality diagrams online ASAP.<br>

                  DMS3 Plus has started shipping. Users will have to upgrade the firmware to 2.3 before being able to use the config mode.<br>
                  Flash 2.3 will be online tomorrow<br>
                  <br>
                  A note on a few operational changes to DMS3 Plus.<br>
                  <br>
                  1) After flash upgrade you will have to reset the machine from standby before the machine will operate as usual.<br>
                  2) After changing settings in conifg mode please go to standby and then restart the console, before playing software.<br>
                  3) In order to boot from the back up bank flash, you are now required to press Reset 4 times in succession.<br>
                  <br>
                  We are currently preparing new diagrams especially for DMS3 Plus. In the meantime we will upload temporary diagrams tomorrow.<br>
                  <br>
                  The clock point on the DMS3 Plus should now be connected to the RF Clock point on the console, commonly known as Y on other mods.<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The V wire is only required on Japanese consoles and should not be connected on USA or PAL machines.<br>
                  <br>
                  On the CDVD bus, the following wires are required for V9/V10:<br>
                  <br>
                  O,P,U,W (+ V wire if console is Japanese/Asian model)<br>
                  <br>
                  for CDVD bus V1-V7:<br>
                  <br>
                  O,P,W (+ V Wire if console is Japanese/Asian model)<br>
                  <br>
                  for CDVD bus V8:<br>
                  <br>
                  O,P,U,V,W<br>
                  <br>
                  All other points remain the same as DMS3 diagrams.<br>

                  <br>
                  DMS Flash upgrade 2.2 has been released and is available in either BIN/CUE or ELF format in the downloads area. This new release fixes a few bugs present in the 2.0 release such as certain games freezing, and problems actually flashing your chip with the upgrade. It also adds a couple of new features such as improved PS2 video fix and support for Codebreaker. For more details see the readme file included with the upgrade archives. Stay tuned for even more updates!<br>
                  <br>
                  <font color="#FFFF00">NOTE: If you have downloaded the flash and cant get it to save your settings (default boot mode has no effect, etc) then please re-download and re-flash your chip. There was a minor issue in the first copy of the 2.2 flash which was uploaded, and has since been fixed.</font><br>
                  <br>

                  <br>
                  We are pleased to announce the release of flash upgrade 2.0. You can download from the Flash upgrade section. The flash has been released initially in BIN and CUE format. We hope to add other release versions over the next few days, but wanted to get the release to our patient users ASAP :P<br>
                  <br>
                  Enjoy the update and apologies for the delays.<br>
                  <br>
                  A word of caution though. The DMS Flash upgrade process requires that the MOD has been installed properly (Check the installation practises page tutorial) If you have used a Ground wire which is too long or of insufficient thickness, or if the other CDVD, Clock or BIOS wires are routed messily or are too long then it is ikely that the upgrade process will fail. Poor installation is the cause of 99% of upgrade failures. If you expeience problems upgrading to flash V2.0 then it's more than likely an installation problem.<br>
                  <br>
                  So in the case of failure, we would suggest that you ensure that the provisions for installation shown on our "Installation practises tutorial" page have been met.<br>
                  <br>
                  The flash upgrade process draws a lot of current, if the POWER and GND wires are to long or not thick enough, the upgrade will fail.<br>
                  Even if the MOD works well enough to boot games, with a bad installation, there is no guarantee that the improperly installed MOD can be upgraded. Please take care of your installation.<br>
                  <br>
                  We have tested flash upgrade by CD on many different versions of PS2 without any issues.<br>

                  We're now fixing the Flash 2.0 to work correctly with the DMS3 1.0 and correcting an issue with DVD region free.<br>

                  <br>
                  <b>Changes since last release</b><br>
                  --------------------------<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  * Problem with V9+ consoles booting DVD-R media fixed<br>
                  * Support for the official US HDD (retail, BETA was already supported)<br>
                  * DMS configuration menu added. Now possible to enable/disable settings,<br>
                  select the default boot mode and check PS2, DMS3 and Flash version info.<br>
                  * You can now force all games to use the native video mode of your console (PAL, NTSC)<br>
                  * Auto-ATAD patching added. You can now play HDD enabled games on a<br>
                  non-Sony HDD, without patching the game disc.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>The configuration menu</b><br>
                  ----------------------<br>
                  <br>
                  To enter the configuration menu hold down the shoulder buttons<br>
                  (L1 + L2 + R1 + R2) on controller 1 as the PS2 is booting. Once<br>
                  in the configuration menu you can enable/disable settings, select the<br>
                  default boot mode and see various version data such as your PS2 version,<br>
                  flash version etc.<br>
                  <br>
                  Default boot mode can be set to "Normal", "Fast Boot", "Dev.olution 1"<br>
                  and "Dev.olution 2". If you are not holding down a button on controller<br>
                  1 when your PS2 is booting to select the boot mode, then DMS3 will use<br>
                  the default boot mode which has been set by the configuration menu<br>
                  (if there is no memory card in slot 1 then DMS3 will use Normal boot).<br>
                  <br>
                  NOTE: Settings are stored on a memory card in slot 1. If you do not<br>
                  have a memory card inserted then you will not be able to save<br>
                  your settings, and DMS3 will use the default settings when you boot.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Notes on HDD support</b><br>
                  --------------------<br>
                  <br>
                  In order to use a non-Sony HDD with HDD-enabled games, you must first<br>
                  enable the ATAD auto patching using the configuration menu.<br>
                  <br>
                  The recently released HDD + FFXI bundle is now supported by DMS3. The<br>
                  new support means that it is possible to boot games from the updated<br>
                  browser - however, in order to launch the PlayOnline Viewer you MUST<br>
                  disable your DMS3 by placing your console in standby, then holding<br>
                  EJECT for a few seconds. You cannot launch the PlayOnline Viewer when<br>
                  the DMS3 is enabled.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Notes on the PS2 video fix</b><br>
                  --------------------------<br>
                  <br>
                  The PS2 video fix function has changed with this release of the flash.<br>
                  In older releases you could force the colour carrier of the video<br>
                  signal, however now you can force the video mode to PAL or NTSC.<br>
                  If the PS2 video fix is enabled using the configuration menu, then all<br>
                  games will run in the native video mode of your console (ie: NTSC for US<br>
                  and JAP consoles, PAL for others).<br>

                  <b>Forums are down whilst we overhaul them and redesign the interface. We'll be back online soon though. In the meantime, pop back here over the next few days for aconfirmed release date of the 2.0 Flash.</b><br>

                  We have decided to release a 2.0 flash instead of 1.9, which has added features as well as the DVD-r boot fix. We are in the initial stages of testing at the moment. The following features have been added:<br>
                  <br>
                  *Configuration menu (acess by pushing L1+L2+R1+R2) during boot sequence.<br>
                  You can turn on and off different boot functions and view version data here.<br>
                  <br>
                  *USA HDD support<br>
                  We're adding support for the newly released USA HDD<br>
                  <br>
                  As promised we've also resolved the boot bug from Standby for DVD-r. We'll release the flash just as soon as we've tested it thoroughly.<br>

                  The DMS Team are now working on a Flash update V1.9 to fix a few bugs in the V1.8 release. Details will follow shortly.<br>

                  We have redesigned the site, giving it a new fresh look for 2k4. We also made navigation of the site easier. Look out for regular updates.<br>

                  We say a big THANK YOU! to WhatNot, Pico, Robot, Premods, Deathwish, Aerick and the ps2newz team. The latest DMS3v9 chip works on the new PS2 v10 model. Thanks for searching and publishing the solder points. Installation diagrams will be online in a few days (we just did not receive a v10 unit yet).<br>

                  We're pleased to announce the release of HDD Explorer! HDD Explorer is an application that allows you to boot homebrew software from a hard disc drive(HDD) installed in your PS2. It will work with either "official" Sony HDDs or unofficial(ie "normal") HDDs. You WILL need the HDD to be a newer make(ie don't try to put a HDD that's 8 years old in it) and recommended to be atleast 40 gigabytes.<br>
                  <br>
                  You will need to upgrade to Flash v1.8 in order to use HDD Explorer. Once installed, HDD Explorer can be booted by pressing the Start button while starting the system(it takes about 15 seconds to boot HDD Explorer).<br>
                  <br>
                  Bundled with HDD Explorer are a set of applications, including PGEN Sega Genesis/Megadrive emulator by that l33t mofo Sjeep. Read the readme.txt file included in the zip for more information, and enjoy!<br>
                  <br>
                  EDIT: HDD Explorer will NOT work with SCPH 10000, SCPH 15000 or SCPH 18000 models, due to the difference in hardware with those models.<br>
                  <br>
                  EDIT AGAIN: The "configuration" menu has some settings which you'll notice are disabled. That's because they are currently unsupported by the flash. Some or all of these options will be supported in the future, but which and when has yet to be decided. DO NOT EXPECT OR DEMAND ANY OF THESE OPTIONS. Thanks.<br>
                  <br>
                  EDIT YET AGAIN: The original "hdd-explorer-installer.zip" which was posted in this thread contained a corrupt ISO. If you have installed HDD explorer using this corrupt ISO (if HDD Dump Tool gives you a yellow screen) then please see below for instructions on how to fix this.<br>

                  <br>
                  EDIT ONE MORE TIME: I've replace all the images again. The other files were incompatible with the v9 chips, and since there're a few already in the market, we can't have that.<br>
                  <br>
                  EDIT AGAIN: I've replaced the other 2 images with images generated with cdgenPS2, as per the instructions listed by someone(sorry, I can't see your name atm) in this thread.<br>
                  <br>
                  EDIT: I've attached another ISO image, this one generated with Nero. Those of you experiencing problems with the other 2 images should try this.<br>

                  We're happy to announce to completion of DMS3 v9, and DMS3 Flash v1.8!<br>
                  <br>
                  Production has already begun for the DMS3 v9 chips, shipments will take place around the middle of next week.<br>
                  <br>
                  DMS3 Flash v1.8 is used for ALL versions of DMS3 hardware, v1.0/v2.0/v9! You'll find 2 files attached to this post, one is an ISO and the other is a BIN/CUE set. Use whichever works best for you.<br>
                  <br>
                  What's new since 1.6C:<br>
                  <br>
                  The Good:<br>
                  <br>
                  Now works with AR MAX.<br>
                  <br>
                  Support for DVD Player 3.00, including RCE protected titles. This is the player that ships with v9 consoles, and<br>
                  is also available with the BroadBand Navigator Upgrade.<br>
                  <br>
                  Slight decrease in the amount of current drawn from the system during system startup/upgrading. This may result in increased stability.<br>
                  <br>
                  Support for the Browser upgrade included in the FFXI US beta kit.<br>
                  <br>
                  Greatly improved PS1 video fix for both PAL and NTSC consoles.<br>
                  <br>
                  Fast boot now uses the Select button.<br>
                  <br>
                  Dev.olution Mode 2(HDD booting) is added. This can be accessed via the Start button. DMS HDD Explorer will be released shortly after the release of Flash v1.8.<br>
                  <br>
                  Miscellaneous little bug fixes and code optimizations.<br>
                  <br>
                  The Bad:<br>
                  <br>
                  Macrovision removal is disabled, due to legal reasons.<br>
                  <br>
                  Auto-selection for DVD movies is removed, due to conflicts with PS2 games on scratched/poor quality media, but will be re-added when a realiable solution is found.<br>
