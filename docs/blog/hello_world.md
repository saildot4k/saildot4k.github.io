# Hello world!
Welcome. You are here because of your interest in the greatest PS2 modchips made.

I too am here for that reason. In 2004 to 2006 I happened to discover soldering and modding PS2 and Xboxes. 
Xbox was my main focus until college was said and done.

Test test test write more. Explain want to feature others collections large and small...
looking for help/writeups/coding, potentially reproduction



So from 2005- Oct 2024 I only had 1 chip, the Crystal Chip 2.0 Pro soldering
And then...somehow by searching far and wide came across these. Not all are shown:
- 104 Crytsal Chip 1.0 Lite
- 1 Crystal Chip 1.2 Lite (may turn into a 2.0)
- 2 Crystal Chip 2.0 Pro SLE wtih 4MB Dataflash AT45DB321-MWU
- 1 More Crystal Chip 1.2+ on the way...
- 4 Ghost 2 v2
- 2 DMS4 SE Lite
- 1 DMS4 SE Pro
- 6 Matrix Infinity Original
