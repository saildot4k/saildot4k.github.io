???+ note "Feature Differences"
    
    All versions retain same functionality EXCEPT v2.0 PRO and v2.0 PRO SLE can boot the dashboard "BootManager"
    from it's internal dataflash storage. Otherwise BootManager will need to be installed to Memcard1,2 or HDD. 
    Full install of BootManager takes 875KB. If there is more storage avaliable, more apps can be installed to 
    Crystal Chip Flash. If an app expects other files in the root directory of the application folder, it will 
    NOT be able to use those files. For example WLE will not see IPCONFIG.DAT nor LAUNCHELF.CNF

    !!! note
        
        v1.2 and later can be upgraded with 4MB dataflash: AT45DB321D-S or AT45DB321D-MW. I have several dozen in stock.
        v1.2 then would need to flash the 2.0 firmware.  Eventually I shall script to ask user if they have installed the larger dataflash.
        Go to BM/FWS/LATEST delete all but "FWARE20.CCI". Rename to "FWARE12DEV0.CCI". Then upgrade firmware choosing option 1.
