???+ note "Crystal Chip Hotkeys"

    Hotkeys can be set to ANY selectable menu item known as a "widget". This is done via BootManager software, NOT firmware (unless someone helps me add that as a feature). This means BootManager MUST be installed to define hotkeys whilst in BM.


## BOOT MODE for Crystal Chip
Each press of the reset button is about once per second, after every blink on Slims.

Recovery Mode: Reset 3x

Disable Chip: Reset 6x
