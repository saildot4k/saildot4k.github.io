This sites intended purpose is to give comprehensive install and usage of the last best PS2 modchips.

If you would like to help in any way, please DM me on Discord, username .r3z3n
Specifically for this site, more writeups, VMC packages for MMCE devices like MemcardPro 2 and SD2PSX
so that users have a quick way to have pre-setup memory cards.
