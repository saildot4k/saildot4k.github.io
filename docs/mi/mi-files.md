### Firmware ISOs

???+ note "I.ELF"

    You can extract I.ELF from Isos and run to update your firmware from Memory Card.
    I shall eventually do this for SD2PSX/MCP2 for ease of updating without working DVD drive, needing to burn CD or needing another PS2.

???- note "Firmware Changelog"

    INFINITY Firmware Upgrade V1.93 24/11/2006
    Release 1.93 of Firmware.

    ADDED:
    Taiwanese V14+ fix

    Notes :
    In certain configurations DEV mode would fail on V14+ Taiwanese machines. Now Fixed.

    -----------------------------------------------

    INFINITY Firmware Upgrade V1.91 20/10/2006
    Release 1.91 of Firmware.

    ADDED:
    Firmware code Enhancement

    Notes :
    Firmware code Enhancement necessary for release of Firmware V2.00.

    -----------------------------------------------

    INFINITY Firmware Upgrade V1.88 01/06/2005
    Release 1.88 of Firmware.

    ADDED:
    Some rare HK models Compatibility fix

    Notes :
    Some compatibility issues on some rare HK models have been fixed.

    -----------------------------------------------

    INFINITY Firmware Upgrade V1.82 14/12/2005
    Release 1.82 of Firmware.

    ADDED:

    ATAD related fixes

    Codebreaker 9.2 Compatibility

    VGA warning screen

    Notes :

    Seems like 1.75 introduced an obscure bug on some games with native HDD support. This is now fixed.

    Codebreaker 9.2 is now fully compatible with the Infinity Firmware.

    When enabling VGA mode a warning screen is now presented to the user. To confirm VGA mode and save the settings, press CIRCLE at the warning screen. In case of any problems, please refer to the VGA mode section below .

    -----------------------------------------------

    INFINITY Firmware Upgrade V1.75 04/12/2005
    Release 1.75 of Firmware.

    ADDED:

    VGA support

    Main language loading fix

    Notes :

    VGA support was added to this firmware release. You can now use the original blaze VGA adapter without the boot CD and enjoy the enhanced games compatibility that this version brings you on your VGA screen (with full original ps2 browser and DVD movies support in VGA mode).
    VGA mode is set to 640x480 at 60Hz (so the added bonus is that PAL games will run 20% faster). Games are automatically centered according to the original resolution without vertical or horizontal side artifacts (a common problem with the original vga adapter). PSX games are not supported at the moment but will probably be in a future release (although this is probably a low priority fix due to the small improvement that VGA support could bring to PSX games).

    When VGA mode is enabled you can access the monitor adjust screen in the config menu by pressing SELECT. You only need to do this the first time to adjust your monitor settings (a white border is present at the side of the screen, play with your monitor settings so that the 640x480 screen completely fills your viewing area).

    A schematic of the cable will be soon online on our site for those skilled in the art of patching things together :)
    The language selected in the browser was not correctly loaded when BOOT MODE was set to DEV1. Program automatically loaded on boot from the memory card had the incorrect default language.

    -----------------------------------------------

    INFINITY Firmware Upgrade V1.68 03/12/2005
    Release 1.68 of Firmware.

    ADDED:

    Full V14 compatibility

    PS2LOGO customization

    Automatic language selection

    Additional memory card boot applications

    Component video related fixes

    Notes :
    Full V14 compatibility added to the firmware.

    Installer/final users can now personalize the logo shown when booting ps2 titles.

    The language and settings selected on the ps2 browser are automatically used when booting MC/HDD applications.

    Two new buttons are now available to launch application directly from memory card. Please refer to the "LAUNCHING MEMORY CARD APPLICATIONS" section.

    Few small fixes for users using a component video cable.

    For detailed specifications read the .TXT files inside the InfinityFW168.zip file.

    To enter the configuration menu press TRIANGLE + CIRCLE during PS2 Boot Up.

    For detailed specifications read the "V15README.TXT" file inside the InfinityFW15.zip file.

## PS2BBL Hotkeys
My Megapacks include PS2BBL as mc?:/BOOT/BOOT.ELF and wLE ISR Exfat as mc?:/BOOT/BOOT2.ELF

Set your modchip to boot from memory card, usually called DEV1. This is to ensure that one download works for all 3rd gen modchips that use such structure.
Prior to PS2BBL booting, your modchip firmware will determine hotkeys. Once you see the PS2BBL logo, you have 5 seconds to push a hotkey, else OSDMenu will launch, and if that is not found, wLE ISR Exfat will launch so long as you do not delete/mess up your BOOT or SYS-CONF folders.

See [PS2BBL](https://israpps.github.io/PlayStation2-Basic-BootLoader/documentation/configuration.html#launch-keys) for documentation.
