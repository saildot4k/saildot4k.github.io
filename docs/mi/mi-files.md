    Release 1.82 of Firmware.

    ADDED:

    ATAD related fixes

    Codebreaker 9.2 Compatibility

    Notes :

    Codebreaker 9.2 is now fully compatible with the Infinity Firmware.

    When enabling VGA mode a warning screen is now presented to the user. To confirm VGA mode and save the settings, press CIRCLE at the warning screen. In case of any problems, please refer to the VGA mode section below .

    -----------------------------------------------

    INFINITY Firmware Upgrade V1.75 04/12/2005
    Release 1.75 of Firmware.

    ADDED:

    VGA support

    Main language loading fix

    Notes :

    VGA support was added to this firmware release. You can now use the original blaze VGA adapter without the boot CD and enjoy the enhanced games compatibility that this version brings you on your VGA screen (with full original ps2 browser and DVD movies support in VGA mode).
    VGA mode is set to 640x480 at 60Hz (so the added bonus is that PAL games will run 20% faster). Games are automatically centered according to the original resolution without vertical or horizontal side artifacts (a common problem with the original vga adapter). PSX games are not supported at the moment but will probably be in a future release (although this is probably a low priority fix due to the small improvement that VGA support could bring to PSX games).

    When VGA mode is enabled you can access the monitor adjust screen in the config menu by pressing SELECT. You only need to do this the first time to adjust your monitor settings (a white border is present at the side of the screen, play with your monitor settings so that the 640x480 screen completely fills your viewing area).

    A schematic of the cable will be soon online on our site for those skilled in the art of patching things together :)
    The language selected in the browser was not correctly loaded when BOOT MODE was set to DEV1. Program automatically loaded on boot from the memory card had the incorrect default language.

    -----------------------------------------------

    Automatic language selection

    Additional memory card boot applications

    Component video related fixes

    Notes :

    Installer/final users can now personalize the logo shown when booting ps2 titles.

    The language and settings selected on the ps2 browser are automatically used when booting MC/HDD applications.

    Two new buttons are now available to launch application directly from memory card. Please refer to the "LAUNCHING MEMORY CARD APPLICATIONS" section.
