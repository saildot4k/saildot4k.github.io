Quick note: of my collection, I have a Blue dot I installed into a V15 GH-052-12. First it did not work and was on older firmware. I installed into a V8 39K and updated to FW 1.93. After the update, the blue dot worked in the V15 GH-052-12. Homebrew works fine for being a Matrix Infinity. I have not tested backups/out of region, just homebrew....

???+ note "Firmware/Greendot HB vs Greendot"

    All versions are upgradable to the latest revision FW (1.93)

    You may need to install into an earlier PS2 to update FW then install in your slim of choice. 

    Only the new Greendot supports the v14 and higher because the bitstream on the FPGA changed
