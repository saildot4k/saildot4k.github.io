# Matrix PicFix


Why? In an attempt to curb piracy, $ony designed the laser to fail and burn up. Sadly this [backfired](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-reaches-settlement-in-ps2-disc-read-error-case#:~:text=Now%20a%20settlement%20has%20been,their%20console%20%2D%20at%20SCEA's%20discretion.)

Invented by the Matrix Team, they designed a cheap and easy fix for V9-V12 PS2s, documented [here](https://github.com/MechaResearch/MechaPwn/blob/master/docs/PICfix.md) and refined by HaloSlayer255 and [ModzvillUSA](https://modzvilleusa.com/products/ps2-matrix-picfix-for-v9-v12-ps2-consoles)


I (R3Z3N) simply applied some artistic touch to make this an easier install that will look professional with decent soldering skills. CLEAN YOUR FLUX BOYS!


### $ony Laser fix identification

If your PS2 is the following model with the circutry in red, you DO NOT NEED THIS FIX!

### Mechacon Crash Tester App

El Isra made a PS2 app which identifies if your console is safe, unsafe or uknown. Run the ELF on your PS2 with your desired exploit/elf launcher of choice:
